-- | Tasty integration with the existing HUnit package.
--   
--   Existing `tasty-hunit` package now declares its own testing
--   primitives. This package provides an integration of the existing HUnit
--   package with Tasty that inter-operates properly with other HUnit code.
@package tasty-hunit-compat
@version 0.1.0


-- | HUnit support for tasty.
--   
--   We don't use `tasty-hunit` directly because it doesn't interoperate
--   properly with other HUnit-based code. Specifically, it defines its own
--   <tt>HUnitFailure</tt> type and catches exceptions of this type. It
--   doesn't catch HUnit's <tt>HUnitFailure</tt>, so they are not
--   pretty-printed.
module Test.Tasty.HUnit

-- | Turn an <a>Assertion</a> into a tasty test case
